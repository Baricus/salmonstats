# `salmonstats`
`salmonstats` is a program for parsing json dumps created via [nxapi](https://gitlab.fancy.org.uk/samuel/nxapi)'s `splatnet3 dump-results` and `splatnet3 monitor` commands.
`nxapi` downloades detailed post-match results in json format.
This is a relatively simple program to analyze and query those results.
